# Automating-Katalon-Demo-Cura-Heroku-App-using-Python-and-Selenium

• Designed and implemented a data-driven test automation framework using Selenium, Python, and Behave (BDD) for testing a healthcare appointment booking application <br />
• Developed and executed BDD feature files using Gherkin syntax, covering various scenarios including valid and invalid login, appointment booking, and logout functionality <br />
• Integrated Excel-based test data parameterization to drive login and appointment booking tests dynamically <br />
• Utilized Pandas for data extraction from Excel, ensuring seamless integration with automated test scripts <br />
• Implemented Page Object Model (POM) to enhance test maintainability and scalability <br />
• Conducted cross-browser testing and handled dynamic elements using Explicit and Implicit Waits in Selenium <br />
• Used WebDriverWait and Expected Conditions to ensure robust and reliable test execution <br />
• Executed test cases efficiently using Behave command-line execution with tagged scenarios for selective test runs <br />
• Analyzed test failures, debugged issues, and optimized scripts for better performance and reliability <br />

Run using the following command in your terminal - <br />
python -m behave features/ <br />
