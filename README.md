# Automating-Katalon-Demo-Cura-Heroku-App-using-Python-and-Selenium

• Designed and implemented a data-driven test automation framework using Selenium, Python, and Behave (BDD) for testing a healthcare appointment booking application
• Developed and executed BDD feature files using Gherkin syntax, covering various scenarios including valid and invalid login, appointment booking, and logout functionality
• Integrated Excel-based test data parameterization to drive login and appointment booking tests dynamically
• Utilized Pandas for data extraction from Excel, ensuring seamless integration with automated test scripts
• Implemented Page Object Model (POM) to enhance test maintainability and scalability
• Conducted cross-browser testing and handled dynamic elements using Explicit and Implicit Waits in Selenium
• Used WebDriverWait and Expected Conditions to ensure robust and reliable test execution
• Executed test cases efficiently using Behave command-line execution with tagged scenarios for selective test runs
• Analyzed test failures, debugged issues, and optimized scripts for better performance and reliability
